### Background

At WWDC 2018, Apple designers gave a talk titled "Designing Fluid Interfaces", explaining the design theory behind the gesture-based interface of iPhone X. (The presentation is available here: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/))

It was an outstanding talk, inspiring designers and developers to think about animated interfaces in a new way. While some technical guidance was provided, most code-level implementation details were ommitted.

The goal with this project is to bridge the gap between inspiration and implementation.

### Installation

Download or clone the repo and open the `FluidInterfaces.xcodeproj` file with Xcode 10.

## Calculator Button
